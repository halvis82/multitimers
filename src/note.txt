on stopwatch:
- 

on timer:
- when finished: ok button, sound (mutable (small speaker icon)), flashing (css animation class (maybe another translucent box on top that stops on click))
- stop timer without mouse? (universal press space)
- showing one number to little when 1 + (x * 0) time (only happened once?)
- when starting timer with mouse after typing -> time lags, sometimes starts from one number (second) less (maybe similar issue to random_note_96)
- when typing -> add left and right arrow to move cursor around
- sometimes stops on 1, even though 50ms added (was tabbed out last time)


notes:
- make option to add and remove timers (small green '+' and red '-' next to title)
- some style difference between timer and stopwatch
- change colors of progress bar when paused (blue?)
- maybe change inline style for progressbar in Timer.js
- make typing work on (i)Phone (invisible number input, time selector wheel, INPUT TYPE TIME -> different code for phone then)
