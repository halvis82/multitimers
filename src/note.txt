on stopwatch:
- 

on timer: 
- 1 button: start/stop/ok
- circle animation on timer than goes around in time of completion (maybe gradually go from green to red)
- when finished: ok button, sound (mutable (small speaker icon)), flashing (css animation class (maybe another translucent box on top that stops on click))
- twitching when starting sometimes -> when starting with mouse from typing state
- when pausing and unpausing, timer sometimes go up/down one second for a split second (dont think it affects actual timer)


notes:
- make it like google timer and stopwatch
- set max box size
- size time numbers better
- make option to add and remove timers (small green '+' and red '-' next to title)
- set favicon (and title?)
- some style difference between timer and stopwatch
- maybe round cs to 2 decimals
- change colors of progress bar when paused
- maybe make progress bar bigger/more visible
