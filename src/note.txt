on stopwatch:
- 1 button: stop/start
- 1 button: reset

on timer: 
- 1 button: start/stop
- 1 button: reset
- count seconds, minutes, hours, from right, but only for units that are present
- circle animation on timer than goes around in time of completion (maybe gradually go from green to red)
- on click time when timer -> 
- add some flashing color when finished (css animation class) (maybe another translucent box on top that stops on click)
- add some sound when finished maybe (mutable) (so small speaker icon appears when timer)


notes:
- make it like google timer and stopwatch
- set max box size
- size time numbers better
- make option to add and remove timers (small green '+' and red '-' next to title)
- set favicon (and title?)
- always use two siffers -> "03" > "3"
- some style difference between timer and stopwatch
- maybe round cs to 2 decimals
- change colors of progress bar when paused
- maybe make progress bar bigger/more visible
- save time on timer/stopwatch on switch

remember:
- stop typing on onBlur() -- 
- useEffect() something to stop interval from somewhere else
